# Plan - we're done if we have good pseudocode
# 1. Read the file `input.txt` and split it into two words
# already read in
# split into two words

# 2. Analyze the text, building up the dataset of which words
# can follow a word.
# Which words can follow a word? Any word that actually does
# any word at index + 1

# 3. Choose a random "start word" to begin.
# 4. Loop through

# Read in all the words in one go
with open("input.txt") as f:
    words = f.read()

# TODO: analyze which words can follow other words
# Your code here


# TODO: construct 5 random sentences
